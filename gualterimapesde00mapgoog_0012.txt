PREFAOE.

'l'rrn work which is now for tho first time printed is the most
authentic of all those which have beon attributed to Walter Mapes,
and certainly the most important. Itis the book in which this
remarkable man seems to have amused himself with putting down
his own sentiments on the passing events of the day, along with
tha popular gossip of the courtiers with whom he mixed. It con-
tains almost the only authentic details we have relating to the life
of its author, besides a great mass of historical anecdotes which
are entirely new to us. In fact, the whole book is one mass of
contemporary anecdota, romanoe, and popular legend, interesting f
equally by its curiosity and by its novelty.

In my Biographia Britannica Literaria (the Anglo-Norman
Period)‚ 1 have given a summary of the information with which
Mapes in this treatise furnishcs us relating to himself, and I need do
little more than repeat here what 1 said on that occasion. The cor-v

rect form of his name appears to have been Map,* but as the Latin-
ised form Mapes has obtained avery extensive degree of popularity‚
lhave thought it was perhaps better to retain it. He was a native
of the borders of Wales, probably of Gloucestcrshire or Hcreford-

* He gives himself this name in the last chapter of his treatise De Napis fluvialium,
and it is eo spelt in all the most authentic documenta.
