PRBFAGE. XV

tc understand. ln producing the present edition, I have bad to
contami with many disadvantages3 the practice ol the Bodleian
library, which does not allow its manuscripts to be lent out on any
conditione, has rendered it impossible lor me to collate the text
mysell with the original, and it has not always been in my power to
consult, in cases of difficulty, scholare on the spot in whose opinion
1 could confide. ln the latter portion of the work 1 have been

Coae, one of the librarians of the Bodleian Library, and the
Rev. W. D. Macray, of New Collega. The difficulty l found pre-

other circumstances, has been the cause oia very considerable

delay in the publication of the present volume, which was com-

Το the delay just alluded to must be attributed any slight differ-

discovered between the earlier and latter parts cithia volume.
My principle has been tc correct all those accidental corruptions
cf Latin orthography which arose merely lrom the ignorance or
carelessness os monkish transcribere, but to retain most of those

present his text, while he preserves its correctness, in a form as
intelligible as possible to the general reader. With this principle

ia view, l have not hesitated to correct the corruptions ol the
manuscript, when that correction appeared addent, and 1 have
added a few notes lor the purpose ol making the text somewhat
