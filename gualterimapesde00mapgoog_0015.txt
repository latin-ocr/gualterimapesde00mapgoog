Mapes appears to have had a special employment in the court
of the young king Henry‚ after he had been crowned by his father,
until his untimely death in 1182, and he shows great affection for
the memory of that princc, and speaks leniently of his errore* lt
appears by the anecdotes related by himself and by Giraldus
Cambrensis that he accompanied king Henry II. in nearly all his
progresses. He was with him in Anjou soon after the election of
Geoffrey to the archbishopric of York‚ in 1183.† ln 1196 Mapes
was appointed archdeacon of Oxford31 from which date we lose
sight of him entirely.

and he was universally admired for his ready wit and humour.
He speaks of himself as enjoying the reputation of a poet,§ but
he gives us no clue to the character of the compositione by which
he had entitled himself to this name. His Latin is very unequal;

but we are perhaps not entirely competent to pronounce j udgmept

in this respect, as the teatin the unique manuscript of his prose

evidently extensive, and his observatione on meu and politica are
judicious and acute. He sometimes rises above the prejudices of
his age, as in his account of Arnold of Brescia,ss whilst at other
